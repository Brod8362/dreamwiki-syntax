# dreamwiki-syntax README

Visual studio code plugin for basic syntax highlighting of  [`dreamwiki`.](https://github.com/free-ghz/dreamwiki).

Will autocomplete ^ and highlights a couple of the different parts of the markup, but ultimately it's very simple as dreamwiki itself is quite simple.

## Todo (maybe)
- Maybe add autocomplete for the different options for tags
- Add hover text for various things
